# GAMPLAY PGORESSIONG IDEA

3 abilities:

1. Start with automatic splits on event eg. doors unlocking, levels something idk, ONLY on events that players do
   
   * Tutorial Level (2/3 doors) - Interior Cyberbuilding Thing
   
   * Level 2 More doors, different setting - Balcony of building maybe  
   
   * Level 3 Catwalk Run

2. Give the player the ability to manually make splits
   
   * 

3. Let the play jump arbitrarily to any of the past 10 splits
