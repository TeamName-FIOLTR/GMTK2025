# LOOP

so some ideas write off the bat:

* idk

* uh

* hold on let me test git rq

* yeah git works, nice

* anyways

# SPLICEPUNK

idea is this:

* speedgame

* but you can save and reload infinitely

* speed is not reset

* can build infinitely

* other items and level can also go without being saved

* so the game centers around speed and save state spamming essentially

* add in the splits ui in the corner for flare

* cyberpunk should be a fast basic aesthetic to get down

* i think i got it, time to go zoom!!!

# LORE:

you are some accursed speedrunner, forever doomed to repeat and repeat the same few seconds over and over again to try and get a perfect time

so like obvi just thinking about it but quick opening:

* big god guy voice be like "FOR YOUR CRIMES AGAINST SPEEDRUNNING, YOU WILL BE CURSED TO FOREVER SPLICE EVERY WAKING DECISION OF YOUR LIFE, IN TOTALITY AND FOREVER UNSATISFIED WITH YOUR TIMES, NO MATTER HOW FAST"

* and then boom cyberpunk stuffs ig lol

* honestly thinking it'd be like ghost runner but way faster

* bro you'd love ghost runner i think that's its name

* point is tho we cookin

# GAMEPLAY

so i'm thinking of making it a level-based thing, were you need to get some *absurdly* fast time to slowly make your way out of splicing purgatory

the way that's done is by making save and load states, both of which the player is required to spam very often, sometimes triggered by game events and in level stuff optionally

but importantly: *they aren't perfect saves and loads*

which means that we can have some stuff just carry over between loops

like

* *speed*

* speed

* and **SPEED**

* and probably some important level stuff, like weapons or important key items

* henk maybe even literal keys you need, like very fast type swipe it out from some perils unwinnable scenario and then boom fast reload then it like u got have had it the whoooole time

* anyways, back to programming
