so some ideas write off the bat:

* idk

* uh

* hold on let me test git rq

* yeah git works, nice

* anyways





# SPLICEPUNK

idea is this:

* speedgame

* but you can save and reload infinitely

* speed is not reset

* can build infinitely

* other items and level can also go without being saved

* so the game centers around speed and save state spamming essentially

* add in the splits ui in the corner for flare

* cyberpunk should be a fast basic aesthetic to get down

* i think i got it, time to go zoom!!!
